This is a part of my discipline challenge and the proof of my progress. This MVP is called Farm Sense AI.
Ever wondered someone told you what type of soil it is, what are the moisture levels, pH levels ,what to plant,
tips to improve the soil just by looking at the soil. Farm Sense AI does that and don't think this gonna take forever to give the results this will give the results in just one minute or lesser than that. Right now it is just 
a simulation I created but it is actually possible by integrating an AI. As this is an MVP I just wanted it to keep
it simple.

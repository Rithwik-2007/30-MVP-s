This is a part of my discipline challenge and the proof of my progress. This MVP is called Smart Day Planner. 
Anything we do should have a plan and but in this AI era we don't sit for hours just to plan our day.
Just say your tasks and this MVP creates a day plan by prioritizing the tasks based on the real world importance
and it allows allocates the time that should be spent on each task based on it's importance and difficulty

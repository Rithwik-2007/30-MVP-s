What is QuestSense?

QuestSense is a lightweight, player-first quest companion.

Instead of dumping full walkthroughs or spoilers in your face, it lets you choose how much help you want, from gentle hints to full step-by-step guidance.

Built for moments like:

“I’m stuck and don’t know what I missed”

“I don’t want spoilers, just a nudge”

“Is this quest bugged or am I doing something wrong?”

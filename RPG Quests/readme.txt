This is a part of my discipline challenge and the proof of my progress. This MVP is called RPG Quest.
Turn your boring errands into a game. Gamify your damn life using this app. This an advanced and interesting version of to-do list app and by advance I don't mean adding AI features to it. Give the app your tasks it turns them into 
quest and give you an optimized map with checkpoints and by completing each tasks you will get XP and by getting 
XP you will level up. Sounds fun right and it creates a story so that errands won't become boring.

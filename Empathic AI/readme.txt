This is a part of my discipline challenge and the proof of my progress. This MVP is called Empathic AI.
This MVP is more than an AI chat bot it detects your emotions while speaking and act accordingly.
It doesn't just take text as the context it will consider both emotion and text and chat with you.
You can turn the camera off if you want it to respect your face and still it is an efficient chatbot
